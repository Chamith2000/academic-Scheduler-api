Special Feature: Smart Auto-Rescheduler with AI Conflict Resolver
This feature ensures minimal disruptions when unexpected changes occur (e.g., a teacher suddenly becomes unavailable).
ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
1. If a teacher cancels a scheduled class, the system automatically finds another available teacher based on subject expertise.
2. If no teacher is available, it suggests time slot changes to avoid cancellation.
3. The system uses AI-driven recommendations to optimise the rescheduling process without affecting other classes.
